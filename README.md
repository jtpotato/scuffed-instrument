# scuffed-instrument
A musical instrument created with Arduino, using a potentiometer to control pitch, and a button to control note length. Uses a (low quality) buzzer to create sound. Includes a servo for a metronome, which has its own button on/off switch. Introduces a rudimentary version of note-stepping to make it (slightly) easier to play.
